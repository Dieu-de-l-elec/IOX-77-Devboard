This is the CAD (3d file) of the IOX-77 devboard.

The original CAD file (.stp) was too big for Github (32MB) so I compressed it. 
To view it, you need to download the file first. I recommend using Autodesk File Viewer: I tried opening it, and everything went smoothly, even the colors were well displayed.
