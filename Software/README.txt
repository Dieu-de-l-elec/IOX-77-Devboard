Coming soon...


*I'm planning to code an Arduino® library for the ESP32 C3 in order to easily control the 'external' GPIOs (handling I2C com with the 5 CH32s) in order to be able to use the GPIOs like we do with any devboard (pinMode(), digitalWrite(), digitalRead(), analogRead(), analogWrite() functions ...). I'll also need to programm the CH32, and I think I'll use the MounRiver Studio to get full command on these MCUs (the arduino IDE doesn't support really well this chip). I did nothing on the sofware side for the moment, because programming CH32 will be a completely different story, and the only way to code the sofware right is by doing trials and errors on the devboard (once I'll receive the board, and when the firmware is working, I'll update it on Github)*
